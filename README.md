BLUEPRINT DCC data model
========================

BLUEPRINT DCC (data communication center) uses a data model initially inspired on, but diverging from, ICGC DCC data model.
BLUEPRINT DCC model takes and maps some elements from IHEC Standard Operating Procedures (http://ihec-epigenomes.org/research/operating-procedures/) for compatibility at metadata level.

The schema methodology used to maintain and develop the BLUEPRINT DCC data model is the one implemented in BP Schema tools (https://github.com/inab/BP-Schema-tools)
