# EPICO data model

EPICO database uses a data model initially inspired on, but diverging from, ICGC DCC data model.
This data model has been used for [BLUEPRINT](http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/), so it takes and maps some elements from [IHEC Standard Operating Procedures](http://ihec-epigenomes.org/research/operating-procedures/) for compatibility at metadata level.

The schema methodology used to maintain and develop the EPICO data model is the one implemented in [BP Schema tools](https://github.com/inab/BP-Schema-tools).

You can find the installation instructions at [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
